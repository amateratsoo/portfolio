### This is the repository for my portfolio and personal website, feel free to pay a visit and sign my guestbook ðŸ¤©âœ¨

<a href='https://jossanidacruz.vercel.app' target='_blank'  style='background-color: #3b82f6; color: #f5f5f5; padding: 4px 8px; border-radius: 8px; font-weight: 500; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>See it live ðŸš€</a>

ðŸª„ This website was built using:

- `next js 14 (app router)`
- `react server componets`
- `react server actions`
- `postgresql` as the database
- `prisma` for the orm
- `tailwindcss` for styling
- `framer motion` for the beatiful animations
- and `typescript` of course

Pretty much that's it. All UI components are custom and built from scratch, please consider to **star ðŸŒŸ** this repository if you like it or want to give it a boost.

#### âœ¨ Here some things i plan to add in the future:

- more projects
- a blog section
- add more ui elements that inspire me

### Thank you for stopping by, you can take a look if you want ðŸ‘‹
